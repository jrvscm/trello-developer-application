## Cover Letter

Dear Name Hiring Manager,

I hope you enjoyed the Trello UI as much as I enjoyed building it. Hopefully it's the first project of many that I get to complete for Trello.

Your Frontend Developer opening is an excellent match to my background. I'm a full-stack developer, but I prefer building beautiful frontend's in React/Redux. However, if need be I can utilize my full stack skills to get things done. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku, and TravisCI, and Git/Github and I’m confident that I can be an immediate asset at Trello.

I love all things development. Most days I can be found, fingertips pounding away at my computer. Whether I'm trying to solve a complex logic issue, or trying to implement a new Framework, I simply can't stop learning and evolving as a programmer. When I was younger I would hear people talk about what they were <em>Meant</em> to do. I never truly knew what that felt like until I started programming. I am truly <em>Meant</em> for this, and I would love to continue to grow and contribute to the amazing team at Trello. 

I'm sure that you receive hundreds of applications for these positions and my experience may alarm you, as I dont have years upon years of on the job expereince. Let me assure you, that is not a problem. I recently completed an excellerated software development course where I learned full stack development and built my portfolio in six months. All while working full time as a SCADA integrator/PLC programmer. I would generally go to work for 8-10 hours per day, then come home and work on Thinkful coursework and develope applications. When I set my mind on something, I finish it. Not only do I finish, I excell. I can only imagine how much I would learn and devlope as a programmer, if I could gain employment with a solid team, and devote all my time to programming, while not having to work around a full time day job. I feel that through the applications I've built and coursework I've completed, I have a very solid command of React/Redux and Node.js. I can most certainly work with Node, but my passion lies in React and frontend architecture.

Recently I worked on a project called Habitualize. Habitualize is a full stack habit tracking application, built with React/Redux and Node.js. Habitualize provides users a way to create and track habits they find useful. Progress can be viewed through a current/best streak implementation and personalized charts and statistics. The technology used for this project was as follows:

### Frontend:
React/Redux,
JavaScript,
HTML5,
CSS3,
Enzyme(testing),
Continuous integration and deployment with TravisCI and Netlify

### Backend:
Node.js (server),
Express (server),
MongoDB/Mongoose/Mlab (database),
Mocha Chai (testing),
Continuous integration and deployment with TravisCI and Heroku

If the credentials detailed in my attached résumé appear well suited to your needs, I would absolutely love the chance to learn more about Trello's goals and outline my strengths in person.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to our conversation.
